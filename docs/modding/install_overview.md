# Installing Aurora
Thumper is a Windows only game and thus we can only officially support modding on Windows, however we put in a lot of effort to made modding work on as many platforms as possible. A list of platform we've gotten modding to work on are listed below. A detailed install guide is available for Windows. There isn't detailed guides for other platforms yet.

## Windows
Windows is Thumper's native build. This is the easiest way to do Thumper modding. All the tooling works with little to no issue on Windows.

If you're on Windows. You may follow the detailed [Windows Install Guide]().

## Linux (Debian Based)
Thumper does't support Linux but it does run via proton. Modding is still possible after jumping through some hoops.

## SteamDeck
SteamDeck is just another Linux distribution but with many things locked down. Many things make SteamDeck hard to support.
