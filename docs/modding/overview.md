# Welcome
Welcome to Thumper modding. This is a small guide to get a new user familiar with the Thumper modding setup.

## Terms
Some important and commonly used terms will be used when discussing Thumper modding. The most common terms are listed below.

### TCLE / TCL
This refers to the [Thumper Custom Level Editor](https://github.com/CocoaMix86/Thumper-Custom-Level-Editor). This is where most of the work is put to make custom levels for Thumper. This is a tool primarily maintained by CocoaMix. This tool is not required to play custom levels.

### TML
This refers to the [Thumper Mod Loader](https://github.com/CocoaMix86/Thumper-Modding-Tool-resharp). This is the **OLD** modding tool. This tool is not longer updated and is incompatable with the current tooling. Aurora should be used instead.

### Aurora
[Aurora](https://github.com/anthofoxo/aurora) is the new and current mod loader for Thumper. This is required to play custom levels. Aurora is also capable of much more but for most users, this should simply be thought of as the new mod loader.

### PC Files
Thumper's data and asset files are composed of `.pc` files. These files are are named with some hex value. The names of these files are computed from an original path from Drool's tooling. For most people you just need to know these files are Thumper's data and assets.
