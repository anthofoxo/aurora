# What Happened to TML?
TML from the very start was a port of an even older tool from a community member who has since left and vanished. TML was then rewritten in C# by CocoaMix, however the structure of the codebase hadn't changed much since the old version. This made it hard to maintain and easy to introduce bugs without developers or users noticing.

As the desire to want more powerful modding tools came alone, a lot of us were tired of doing hex editing to achieve what we want. We despired a more expressive codebase to perform our mod loading. This led to the creation of Aurora.

Aurora was written from the ground up with a focus on code maintainability focued on from the start. This allowed us stop keeping TML on life support and lets us move onto better things, additionally deprecating TML relieved pressure from the main developer of TCLE.

Aurora can do everything TML can but the code behind it is much more readable and expandable for the future.
