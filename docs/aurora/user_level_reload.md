# Reloading Levels
Aurora can allow levels to be reloaded while Thumper is running under these specific circumstances:

* Thumper is already running
* The levels you want reloaded are already in the level listing
* Aurora can run standalone

If these requirements are currently met then launch Thumper and make sure the levels you want to be able to auto update are enabled.

Once you boot the game, the Aurora window will close. Open your `Thumper Directory` and simply launch the `.jar` file. Aurora should boot in standalone mode with the same mod choices the game was launched with.

At this point you may update a TCLE level. Then in aurora simply click the "Build Mods" button. This will rebuild the level contents. (Menu UI Changes require a Thumper Restart).

To see the changes in Thumper you just have to quit the level, return to the level selection menu and restart the level.
