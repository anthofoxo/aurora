To do this perform the following actions: Open your Steam Library, right click on Thumper , click Manage , then click Browse local files . Remember this folder location. We will refer to this as the Thumper Directory . Delete the cache folder in the Thumper Directory . Open your Steam Library, right click on Thumper , click Properties... , click Installed Files , then click Verify integrety of game files . Steam will then proceed to redownload the cache directory and put the game into a vanilla state. Installing Java Aurora requires Java 25 to be installed. Java must be installed via an installer. Aurora relies on certain registry keys to exist. Using an installer will ensure this happens properly. You can visit the Oracle website to find the download links. Install Java using the Windows x64 MSI Installer . Use this same installer even if you are on Linux. Just install it via Wine. Shared Library Configuration Aurora expects steam_api64.dll.bak to exist in the Thumper Directory . This is simply a copy of steam_api64.dll . If this .bak file doesn't already exist then copy/pase steam_api64.dll as steam_api64.dll.bak . Linux and Proton Configuration If you are using Linux, two additional changes are required: Add the following launch flag: WINEDLLOVERRIDES=\"steam_api64.dll=n,b\" %command% Make sure Thumper is ran using the experimental version of proton. Aurora Install To finally proceed with the install. Download the latest .zip file from GitHub . Once downloaded you want to directly extract this into the Thumper Directory . Confirm any overwrites if needed. Testing and Aurora Configuration At this point Aurora should be installed and ready to go. To validate this simply launch Thumper. If all went well the Aurora application should appear. You'll be prompted to select a Thumper Executable. Select and of the .exe files. The Aurora GUI will have a small guide on adding mod paths. Once ready. Click the Launch Thumper button. Aurora will proceed to build the targets and begin the game. Standalone Mode Aurora can also run standalone mode. This may be useful in a few situation. The .jar file that is downloaded is executable. If Java is installed correctly you can simply open this file. When in standalone mode, Aurora will be unable to directly launch Thumper. Instead you are given the option to Build Mods . Uninstalling Aurora If you want to uninstall Aurora. You can simply delete steam_api64.dll and rename steam_api64.dll.bak to steam_api64.dll . This will prevent Aurora from running on game startup. You may delete the .jar file if you want.","title":"User Installation Guide"},{"location":"user_install_guide/#user-installation-guide","text":"","title":"User Installation Guide"},{"location":"user_install_guide/#prerequisites","text":"","title":"Prerequisites"},{"location":"user_install_guide/#put-thumper-in-a-vanilla-state","text":"Thumper should be in an entirely vanilla state before installing Aurora.
