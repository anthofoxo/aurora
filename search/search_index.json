If not familiarize yourself with this process first. Eclipse IDE Aurora is primarily developed in Eclipse. Download and install eclipse for your platform. Clone the repo Head over to Aurora github repo and clone the repo. There are no submodules included in aurora. All libraries Aurora requires are shipped in the repo. Create Project Launch eclipse and select the Java 25 installation on your system. Once eclipse boots. Import the existing aurora project files. Select the java folder in the repo. Double check the window. If an option is given to create module-info.java UNCHECK THIS . Aurora DOES NOT support modules at this time. Launch Arguments When you launch Aurora in eclipse F11 you may see some warnings in your console. Edit your runtime configuration and add the following VM arguments. --enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED --sun-misc-unsafe-memory-access=allow Testing in Integrated Mode To test in integrated mode. You must put the generated class files into the Thumper directory. However this is a very annoying an manual process. A much better solution is to create symlinks. These are special folders that you can create that point to existing folders. So we will create 3 symlinks in the Thumper directory. aurora_bin aurora_res aurora_lib If you launch Thumper and a .jar file cannot be found. It'll attempt to use these folders to load Aurora if they are present. Note that this means the Aurora.jar file must either be removed or renamed by changing the .jar extension. If this isn't done then the .jar file is used and not the IDE generated code. Generating SymLinks This demonstrates how to do this on Windows and with a shell extension. The same can be done on linux. List lookup how to create symlinks for your platform. I use this shell extension . This adds a new option to your context menu. Pick Link Source and Drop Link As . This allows you to simply right click the source folder in aurora and select them as source. Then in the thumper directory, you simply drop them as a symbolic link. Repeat this process for the 3 folders listed above. After this is done, remove or rename the .jar and thumper will run aurora in dev mode. In this situtation. A debug socket is opened to allow you to attach eclipse to the runtime. Attaching to the Socket In eclipse you can add a debug configuration pretty simply. Create the configuration. Specify localhost for the host and 5005 for the port. When aurora is running in integrated mode, you can attach this debugger and debug. Ignoring Build Targets When testing code in standalone mode you may want to actually launch thumper after debugging in standalone. Typically you dont want aurora to regenerate or overwrite existing work that was done. To simply tell aurora to ignore targets. Use the Advanced -> Ignore Targets option in the Mod Loader . Aurora will simply not build the levels and launch thumper as is.","title":"Developer Installation and Setup Guide"},{"location":"aurora/dev_setup_guide/#developer-setup-and-installation-guide","text":"It is highly recommended you already have had aurora installed before.

To do this perform the following actions: Open your Steam Library, right click on Thumper , click Manage , then click Browse local files . Remember this folder location. We will refer to this as the Thumper Directory . Delete the cache folder in the Thumper Directory . Open your Steam Library, right click on Thumper , click Properties... , click Installed Files , then click Verify integrety of game files . Steam will then proceed to redownload the cache directory and put the game into a vanilla state. Installing Java Aurora requires Java 25 to be installed. Java must be installed via an installer. Aurora relies on certain registry keys to exist. Using an installer will ensure this happens properly. You can visit the Oracle website to find the download links. Install Java using the Windows x64 MSI Installer . Use this same installer even if you are on Linux. Just install it via Wine. Shared Library Configuration Aurora expects steam_api64.dll.bak to exist in the Thumper Directory . This is simply a copy of steam_api64.dll . If this .bak file doesn't already exist then copy/pase steam_api64.dll as steam_api64.dll.bak . Linux and Proton Configuration If you are using Linux, two additional changes are required: Add the following launch flag: WINEDLLOVERRIDES=\"steam_api64.dll=n,b\" %command% Make sure Thumper is ran using the experimental version of proton. Aurora Install To finally proceed with the install. Download the latest .zip file from GitHub . Once downloaded you want to directly extract this into the Thumper Directory . Confirm any overwrites if needed. Testing and Aurora Configuration At this point Aurora should be installed and ready to go. To validate this simply launch Thumper. If all went well the Aurora application should appear. You'll be prompted to select a Thumper Executable. Select and of the .exe files. The Aurora GUI will have a small guide on adding mod paths. Once ready. Click the Launch Thumper button. Aurora will proceed to build the targets and begin the game. Standalone Mode Aurora can also run standalone mode. This may be useful in a few situation. The .jar file that is downloaded is executable. If Java is installed correctly you can simply open this file. When in standalone mode, Aurora will be unable to directly launch Thumper. Instead you are given the option to Build Mods . Uninstalling Aurora If you want to uninstall Aurora. You can simply delete steam_api64.dll and rename steam_api64.dll.bak to steam_api64.dll . This will prevent Aurora from running on game startup. You may delete the .jar file if you want.","title":"User Installation Guide"},{"location":"aurora/user_install_guide/#user-installation-guide","text":"","title":"User Installation Guide"},{"location":"aurora/user_install_guide/#prerequisites","text":"","title":"Prerequisites"},{"location":"aurora/user_install_guide/#put-thumper-in-a-vanilla-state","text":"Thumper should be in an entirely vanilla state before installing Aurora.

It also contains a few u32 values of which the purpose are unclear at the moment. These values are probably not important in the grand sceme of things, as all .objlib files of the same type seem to contain the same set of values.

For each external object, the object type , object name and the original file path of the .objlib file containing that object are specified, For each object defined within the current file, the object type amd pbkect name are specified. Object Definition This section contains the definition of each object listed in the Object List section. The objects in this section are defined in the same order as they are listed in the Object List section. There is no clear marker to separate the boundary between two objects.
